1. Right now, all saved data get used when the user checks for reports. A choice should be available to allow viewing statistics from just the past day/week/month. This requires modifying timeLog.json to include a datetime timestamp.
2. AppKit stopped working during development, which made it impossible to track tasks automatically (which was the original goal). The problem might be with my installation of Python, this is the main thing to fix later on.
